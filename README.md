Japanese time &amp; duration practice app

# Running locally

The web app must be served from a local HTTP(s) server, since it makes use of
module scripts. Example:

```sh
$ python3 -m http.server
```

# Tests

From your terminal, enter the
[`./js`](https://github.com/domfarolino/japanese-practice-time/tree/master/js)
directory and run:

```sh
$ node node_test.js
$ git diff all-test-output.txt # Observe any diffs in the output
```
